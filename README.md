### Analysing omics data sets with weighted nodes networks (WNNets)

###### G. Tosadori, D. Di Silvestre, F. Spoto, P. Mauri, C. Laudanna and G. Scardoni

The code in the repository allows reproducing all the findings and all the figures that are presented in the published manuscript.

All the code was developed for R.

It is recommended, to obtain all the plots, to run the command from the **R command line** with the following syntax:

`source("scriptName.R", print.eval=T)`

or from RStudio using **Source with Echo** or Shift+Ctrl+Enter.

STRING database v11 was used to obtain protein-protein interactions information.
